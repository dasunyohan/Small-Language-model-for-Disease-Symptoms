## Dataset Loading

We start by loading a relevant dataset on diseases and symptoms from Hugging Face datasets. This dataset is essential as it provides the text data required to train the language model effectively.

## Tokenization and Model Setup

The next step involves tokenization, a process of converting text into a format that the model can understand. We utilize GPT-2's tokenizer for this task. Following tokenization, we initialize the GPT-2 language model, preparing it for training.

## Training Loop

In the training loop, the model learns to generate text based on the input data. Each epoch involves multiple iterations where the model's performance is monitored through training and validation losses. This ensures that the model is learning effectively and making progress.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

To optimize the model's performance, we fine-tune various hyperparameters such as batch sizes and learning rates. Adjusting these parameters helps in achieving better accuracy and efficiency during training.

## Text Generation

After training, the model is capable of generating meaningful text based on input strings. This step demonstrates the power of the trained model, showcasing its ability to understand and produce coherent text related to diseases and symptoms.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Download the dataset from Hugging Face.

## Usage

Once everything is set up, you can start training the model with the provided scripts. After training, use the model to generate text and explore its capabilities in understanding diseases and symptoms.
